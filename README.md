Customer Issue Resolution System
# PhonePe Customer Issue Resolution System - Java LLD Implementation

## Overview
This is a comprehensive Low Level Design (LLD) implementation of PhonePe's Customer Issue Resolution System in Java. The system handles customer complaints, agent management, and intelligent issue assignment with proper load balancing and waitlist management.

## Architecture & Design Patterns

### 1. **Model Classes**
- **Issue**: Represents customer complaints with transaction details, status tracking, and resolution information
- **Agent**: Represents customer service agents with expertise areas, availability status, and work history
- **IssueType & IssueStatus**: Enums for type safety and better code maintainability
- **IssueFilter**: Filter criteria for advanced issue searching

### 2. **Strategy Pattern Implementation**
- **AssignmentStrategy**: Interface for different issue assignment algorithms
- **LoadBalancingAssignmentStrategy**: Assigns issues to agents with least workload
- **RoundRobinAssignmentStrategy**: Distributes issues evenly across available agents

### 3. **Service Layer**
- **IssueResolutionService**: Main service class implementing all core functionality
- Thread-safe operations using ConcurrentHashMap
- Comprehensive error handling and validation

## Core Features Implemented

### âœ… **Required Functions**
1. **createIssue(transactionId, issueType, subject, description, email)**
   - Creates new customer issues with unique ID generation
   - Automatic timestamp tracking and status initialization

2. **addAgent(agentEmail, agentName, List<issueType>)**
   - Onboards new agents with expertise-based categorization
   - Initializes agent waitlists and work history tracking

3. **assignIssue(issueId)**
   - Intelligent assignment based on agent expertise and availability
   - Automatic waitlist management when all agents are busy
   - Load balancing across available agents

4. **getIssues(filter)**
   - Advanced filtering by email, issue ID, type, status, and agent
   - Supports multiple filter criteria combinations

5. **updateIssue(issueId, status, resolution)**
   - Status updates with optional resolution details
   - Maintains issue lifecycle integrity

6. **resolveIssue(issueId, resolution)**
   - Marks issues as resolved with resolution details
   - Automatic agent availability update and next issue assignment

7. **viewAgentsWorkHistory()**
   - Comprehensive work history tracking per agent
   - Performance analytics and workload monitoring

### ðŸš€ **Advanced Features**
- **Multiple Assignment Strategies**: Pluggable strategy pattern for different assignment algorithms
- **Thread Safety**: Concurrent data structures for multi-threaded environments
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests covering edge cases and error scenarios
- **System Statistics**: Real-time monitoring of system performance and metrics
- **Waitlist Management**: Automatic queue management when agents are busy
- **Load Balancing**: Even distribution of workload across agents

## SOLID Principles Implementation

### **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
- Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility
- Issue class handles issue data, Agent class handles agent data
- Service class focuses on business logic coordination

### **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
- Assignment strategies can be extended without modifying existing code
- New issue types and statuses can be added via enums

### **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
- All assignment strategy implementations are interchangeable
- Interface contracts are properly maintained

### **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
- AssignmentStrategy interface is focused and minimal
- No unnecessary method dependencies

### **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
- Service depends on AssignmentStrategy abstraction, not concrete implementations
- Easy to inject different strategies for testing and flexibility

## Usage Examples

### **Basic Usage**
```java
IssueResolutionService service = new IssueResolutionService();

// Create agents
String agent1 = service.addAgent("agent1@phonepe.com", "Agent 1", 
    Arrays.asList(IssueType.PAYMENT_RELATED, IssueType.GOLD_RELATED));

// Create issues
String issue1 = service.createIssue("T1", IssueType.PAYMENT_RELATED, 
    "Payment Failed", "Money debited but payment failed", "customer@test.com");

// Assign and resolve
service.assignIssue(issue1);
service.resolveIssue(issue1, "Amount refunded successfully");
```

### **Advanced Filtering**
```java
// Search by customer email
IssueFilter emailFilter = new IssueFilter();
emailFilter.setEmail("customer@test.com");
List<Issue> customerIssues = service.getIssues(emailFilter);

// Search by issue type
IssueFilter typeFilter = new IssueFilter();
typeFilter.setType(IssueType.PAYMENT_RELATED);
List<Issue> paymentIssues = service.getIssues(typeFilter);
```

### **Custom Assignment Strategy**
```java
// Use Round Robin assignment
IssueResolutionService service = new IssueResolutionService(
    new RoundRobinAssignmentStrategy());
```

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### **Comprehensive Test Coverage**
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing
- **Edge Case Testing**: Error scenarios and boundary conditions
- **Performance Testing**: Load balancing and concurrent access

### **Test Scenarios Covered**
- Basic CRUD operations
- Waitlist functionality when agents are busy
- Multiple assignment strategies
- Filter combinations and edge cases
- Concurrent access and thread safety
- Error handling and validation

## Performance Characteristics

### **Time Complexity**
- Issue Creation: O(1)
- Agent Assignment: O(n) where n = number of agents
- Issue Search: O(m) where m = number of issues
- Resolution: O(1) + O(k) where k = waitlist size

### **Space Complexity**
- Overall: O(n + m + w) where n = agents, m = issues, w = waitlist entries
- Thread-safe concurrent data structures
- Efficient memory usage with proper data structure selection

## Scalability Considerations

### **Horizontal Scaling**
- Service layer can be distributed across multiple instances
- Database persistence can be added without changing core logic
- Load balancers can distribute requests across service instances

### **Vertical Scaling**
- Thread-safe implementation supports multi-core processing
- Efficient algorithms minimize CPU and memory usage
- Configurable assignment strategies for different load patterns

## Production Readiness Features

### **Error Handling**
- Comprehensive validation of input parameters
- Graceful handling of edge cases and error scenarios
- Detailed logging and error reporting

### **Monitoring & Analytics**
- Real-time system statistics
- Agent performance tracking
- Issue resolution metrics

### **Extensibility**
- Plugin architecture for assignment strategies
- Easy addition of new issue types and statuses
- Configurable business rules and policies

## Running the Application

### **Demo Application**
```bash
javac -cp src src/main/java/com/phonepe/issueresolution/IssueResolutionSystemDemo.java
